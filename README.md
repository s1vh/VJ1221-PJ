# VJ1221-PJ
VJ1221 project (2015/16)

This is a GLSL WebGL demo.

You can increase/decrease the number of orbits with ADD and SUBS keys respectively.
There's a pause/play function by preshing the P key. Also, you can control pair and odd rings separately with the numpad.
You can iterate through a sort of materials with the M key.
Note that the C key that was intended to switch between different shaders for testing purposes has been disabled on the final version.

Camera can be handled by mouse dragging: drag for angle, SHIFT + dragging for zoom and ALT + SHIFT + dragging for perspective.
Zoom and fovy ranges have been adjusted.

Background uses two sphere maps with transparency in order to create a more realistic depth effect.

For more detailed information, check annotations at source code.
